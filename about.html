    <h1 class="headings">Hobbies:</h1>
    <p><img src="images/SpellBreak1.jpg" id=SpellBreak height="300" width="600" >I don't do many things for fun. Mainly I play video games, the three games I play are "Fortnite: Save the World",
      "League of Legends", and "SpellBreak". Fortnite Save the World is a game where you team up with 3 other people to complete a objective usually involving defending an area from invading "husks";
      these are like zombies. Completing these missions can complete quests which further expands the story to uncover why 98% of the world population is missing.
      League of Legends is a "MOBA" type game, there are 5 people in each team, 3 lanes, and 2 jungle areas. Work together to break the enemy's crystal called a nexus.
      SpellBreak(image & gif to the left) is a "Battle Royale" game where people can fight other mages in teams of four, two, and even solo with magic gauntlets.
      Each magic type has interactions with each other and can cause utter pandemonium on the battlefield. With special runes, amulets, and boots not to mention multiple rarities
      of items, this add a fun complexity to the game so there isn't redundancy.
      I do coding which is more of a hobbie I rarely do but, it still a big interest of mine.
      Another hobbie of mine is photography and cinematography although I am not the best at it.</p>
