  <h1 class="headings">General:</h1>
  <p><img src="images/David.png" height="150" width="600">I am an Asian American, Bay Area native from humble beginnings. I am from Chinese immigrant parents and is the youngest of twelve. My passions are anything in the medical field and computer science although I am still learning a lot in both.
    I hope to work in the medical field and as an anesthesiologist in the future. At the time of writing this, I am currently 14 and attend Oakland Technical High School.</p>

  <h1 class="headings">Hobbies:</h1>
  <p><img src="images/SpellBreak1.jpg" id="SpellBreak" height="300" width="600">I do many things for fun. Mainly I play video games, the three games I play are "Fortnite: Save the World", "League of Legends", and "SpellBreak".<br> Fortnite Save the
    World is a game where you team up with 3 other people to complete an objective usually involving defending an area from invading "husks"; these are like zombies. Completing these missions can complete quests which further expands the story to
    uncover why 98% of the world population is missing. League of Legends is a "MOBA" type game, there are 5 people in each team, 3 lanes, and 2 jungle areas. Work together to break the enemy's crystal called a nexus. SpellBreak(image & gif to the
    left) is a "Battle Royale" game where people can fight other mages in teams of four, two, and even solo with magic gauntlets. Each magic type has interactions with each other and can cause utter pandemonium on the battlefield. With special runes,
    amulets, and boots not to mention multiple rarities of items, this adds a fun complexity to the game so there isn't redundancy.<br> I do coding which is more of a hobby I rarely do but, it still a big interest of mine. Another hobby of mine is
    photography and cinematography although I am not the best at it.
